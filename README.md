# eVisitor

eVisitor provides all requests given in the web application case


## About The "eVisitor "

eVisitor web application covers every task in the case. In addition to these tasks, I added a field to the database called "deletedAt" and showed that comments can be deleted via the interface. In addition, I designed a museum-themed, simple-to-use interface that everyone can use.

## Languages ​​and Frameworks
While developing the eVisitor application, I used javascript, css and html. 
I used node.js and express.js frameworks in the backend part.
I chose mysql as the database.
