eVisitor provides all requests given in the web application case


## About The "eVisitor "

The eVisitor web application covers every task in the case. In addition to these tasks, I added a field called "deletedAt" to the database and showed that comments can be deleted via the interface. I also designed a museum-themed, responsive and simple-to-use interface that anyone can use.

## Languages ​​and Frameworks
While developing the eVisitor application, I used javascript, css and html. 
I used node.js and express.js frameworks in the backend part.
I chose mysql as the database.


## eVisitor App
Here, when the visitor writes her full name and message and presses the send button, the messages are saved with the current date in the Visitor Messages field below.
