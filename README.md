## About The "eVisitor "

The eVisitor web application covers every task in the case. In addition to these tasks, I added a field called "deletedAt" to the database and showed that comments can be deleted via the interface. I also designed a museum-themed, responsive and simple-to-use interface that anyone can use.

## Languages ​​and Frameworks
While developing the eVisitor application, I used javascript, css and html. 
I used node.js and express.js frameworks in the backend part.
I chose mysql as the database.


## eVisitor App
Here, when the visitor writes her full name and message and presses the send button, the messages are saved with the current date in the Visitor Messages field below.

When a new visitor adds a message, we can follow it from the console as follows:

For example, when the message of the visitor whose full name is Will is deleted, we can follow it from the console like this:(
This feature was not specified in the case, I wanted to add such a feature.)

In addition, after the data is deleted, when the page is refreshed, that data will not appear in the interface. But other data, namely visitor messages, remain as they were added.

In this way, all visitors I have added so far can be seen in the database, along with their messages and the time they were added. All data has been added to the database
Each visitor has a unique ID.
