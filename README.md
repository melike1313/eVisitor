eVisitor provides all requests given in the web application case


## About The "eVisitor "

The eVisitor web application covers every task in the case. In addition to these tasks, I added a field called "deletedAt" to the database and showed that comments can be deleted via the interface. I also designed a museum-themed, responsive and simple-to-use interface that anyone can use.

## Languages ​​and Frameworks
While developing the eVisitor application, I used javascript, css and html. 
I used node.js and express.js frameworks in the backend part.
I chose mysql as the database.
